# Terraform

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

Plese check the [Terraform home page](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) to get more information and the usability.
